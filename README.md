# English-Dictionary
Created an English Dictionary using a data set with around ~50k words and definitions. Includes a 'Did you mean? ___' method for spell checking and returning the closest word to the user's input. It then asks the user if that specific word is what they were referring to. Will eventually turn this into a web application. Just the base code for now.
